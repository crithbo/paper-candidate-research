# Open-source Cache Dataset

The open-source cache dataset were compiled from multiple sources, including Microsoft, CloudPhysics, Tencent, Alibaba, Twitter, Meta production systems. 
We provide both plain text and [oracleGeneral](#oraclegeneral-format-structure) format. 

You can use the dataset to perform different tasks, including but not limited to:
* **Evaluation**: Testing your caching systems (Memcached, Redis, database bufferpool)
* **Analysis**: Gaining insights about production systems and observing access patterns (diurnal, weekly)
* **Research**: Designing and evaluating new distributed systems and databases

The datasets are stored in AWS S3. You can either download the traces to your local cluster, or launch some EC2 instances to perform computation. Since the dataset is large, we recommend provisioning a cluster to run the computation.You can use [mountpoint](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3) to mount the bucket on each node and [distComp](https://github.com/1a1a11a/distComp) to launch computation jobs.

### Dataset Formats

We provide both plain text format that is human readable and `oracleGeneral` format that is suitable for using with [libCacheSim][libCacheSim] platform. 

#### OracleGeneral Format Structure

```c
struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint64_t obj_id;
    uint32_t obj_size;
    int64_t next_access_vtime;  // -1 if no next access
}
```

All datasets are compressed with [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd). You can use `zstd -d` to decompress the data. 

> [!NOTE]
> libCacheSim can directly work with compressed data, so no decompression is needed if you use libCacheSim to run simulations.

## Twitter Twemcache request traces
This dataset continas the traces from Twitter's in-memory key-value caching (Twemcache/Pelikan) clusters. 
The traces were collected from 54 clusters in Mar 2020. The traces are one-week-long. 
Note that these cache clusters are first-level caches, so the data popularity of this dataset is highly skewed. 


The details of the trace can be found in [*A large scale analysis of hundreds of in-memory cache clusters at Twitter*](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/yang).

### Trace Format
The original traces are plain text structured as comma-separated columns. Each row represents one request in the following format.

* `timestamp`: the time when the cache receives the request, in sec
* `anonymized` key: the original key with anonymization
* `key size`: the size of key in bytes
* `value size`: the size of value in bytes, could be 0 if it is a cache miss
* `client id`: the anonymized clients (frontend service) who sends the request
* `operation`: one of get/gets/set/add/replace/cas/append/prepend/delete/incr/decr
* `TTL`: the time-to-live (TTL) of the object set by the client, it is 0 when the request is not a write request.

# Object Cache Traces

## Meta CDN request traces
This is a CDN request dataset collected in March 2023 and April 2025. The original release can be found at [here][src-meta].

### 202504
Those are traces captured for 7 consecurive days from a selected CDN edge cluster. The cluster contains around 300 hosts. Each host uses roughly 105GB DRAM and 3577 GB SSD for caching. Traffic factor is 1/7.08. Scaled cache size DRAM 15150MB, SSD 1032294 MB.

### 202303
These traces were captured from Meta's 3 selected CDN cache clusters (named nha, prn, eag) respectively for 7 days. 

Each cluster consists of 1000's of hosts. Each host uses (roughly) 40 GB of DRAM and 1.8TB of SSD for caching. 
Traffic factor and scaled cache sizes are:
* nha: 1/6.37, DRAM 6006 MB, NVM 272314 MB
* prn: 1/4.58, DRAM 8357 MB, NVM 375956 MB
* eag: 1/13.4, DRAM 2857 MB, NVM 129619 MB

I believe these CDN cache clusters are the edge clusters (rather than FNA clusters) given their sizes and compulsory miss ratios. 
Meta CDN uses a two-layer hierarchy, where the first layer is [FNA cluster](https://partners.facebook.com/network/landing_page) (they are also called MNA, Meta Network Appliance). FNA clusters are small and deployed inside ISP networks. Cache misses from the FNA cluster go to a larger edge cluster deployed in an IXP data center. 

### Trace Format
* `timestamp`: the timestamp of the request
* `cacheKey`: anonymized object ID
* `OpType`: unknown, but it seems only contains value 1
* `objectSize`: the size of the object in byte
* `responseSize`: the HTTP response size 
* `responseHeaderSize`: the HTTP response header size,
* `rangeStart`: the start offset of a range request, -1 if it is not a range request
* `rangeEnd` the end offset of a range request, -1 if it is not a range request
* `TTL`: time-to-live in seconds
* `SamplingRate`: trace collection sampling ratio, should be ignored because sampled traces from many hosts are mixed
* `cache_hit`: value 1 indicates this request is a cache hit, 0 indicates a cache miss
* `item_value`: unknown, value is either 0 or 1
* `RequestHandler`: unknown 
* `cdn_content_type_id`: annoymized content type id, it is either int or -
* `vip_type`: unknown

## Wikimedia CDN Request Traces

This dataset contains traces from Wikimedia CDN infrastructure. It includes datasets collected at different times (2008, 2016, and 2019) with different formats. We omit the 2008 version as it doesn't have object size information and is incomplete.

The original release can be found at [here][src-wiki].

### 2019 

This dataset is a restricted snapshot of the `wmf.webrequest` table. It consists of 42 compressed files covering 21 days of data: 21 files contain upload (image) request data (`cache-u`), and 21 contain text pageview request data (`cache-t`). Each file covered an exactly 24-hour period. <!-- For open-sourced traces, 21 traces are contactnated as one file respectively and object id is salted. -->

#### Upload Data Format

- `relative_unix`: Seconds since dataset start
- `hashed_path_query`: Salted hash of request path and query
- `image_type`: Image type: `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `svg+xml`, `x-icon`, `tiff`, `webp`, `vnd.djvu`, `x-xcf`
- `response_size`: Response size in bytes
- `time_firstbyte`: Time to first byte in seconds (float)

#### Text Data Format

### 2016

These are request traces collected from Wikimedia’s upload cache infrastructure. The traces span two consecutive weeks and were captured from a single front-end cache node (`cp4006`) located in the ulsfo data center. Each node has (roughly) 96 GB of DRAM for memory caching and (roughly) 720 GB of SSD for disk caching. The trace was filtered to include only user traffic with 200 OK responses, and hashed URLs to preserve privacy. The effective sampling corresponds to requests routed through a single cache. The data includes anonymized object identifiers, response sizes, content types, and latency metrics, and has been used for performance evaluation of cache replacement policies.


#### Trace Format

- `hashed_host_and_path`: Salted hash of request host and path
- `uri_query`: Full requested URL with query parameters (plaintext)

## Tencent Cloud EBS Traces

This dataset consists of 216 I/O trace files collected from a production cloud block storage (CBS) system over a 10-day period (October 1–10, 2018). The traces originate from a single warehouse (also known as a failure domain), covering I/O requests from 5,584 cloud virtual volumes (CVVs). These requests were ultimately redirected to a storage cluster comprising 40 storage nodes (i.e., disks).

These traces were well-suited for per-volume analysis, i.e., studying access patterns of individual CVVs by grouping requests by VolumeID. More details on the dataset can be found in [*OSCA: An Online-Model Based Cache Allocation Scheme in Cloud Block Storage Systems*](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/zhang-yu).

### Trace Format

- `Timestamp`: Time the I/O request was issued, given in Unix time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970)
- `Offset`: Starting offset of the I/O request, in sectors (1 sector = 512 bytes) from the beginning of the logical volume for the original released traces (converted to bytes in our open-sourced traces)
- `Size`: Transfer size of the I/O request, in sectors
- `IOType`: Type of operation — 0 for Read, 1 for Write
- `VolumeID`: Anonymized ID of the cloud virtual volume (CVV)

## Alibaba Cloud EBS Traces

The dataset was collected from a production cluster of Alibaba Cloud's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) service, which provides virtual disk storage. A total of 1,000 virtual disks were randomly sampled from the cluster. All I/O activities to these disks were recorded for the entire month of January 2020. 

The selected disks are Ultra Disk products, a cost-effective tier in Alibaba Cloud’s block storage offerings. Ultra Disks are backed by a distributed storage system that ensures high reliability but with relatively lower random I/O performance compared to Standard SSD or Enhanced SSD products. Typical applications of Ultra Disks include OS hosting, web servers, and big data workloads. More details on the dataset can be found in [*An In-Depth Analysis of Cloud Block Storage Workloads in Large-Scale Production*](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pclee/www/pubs/iiswc20.pdf) and [Github](https://github.com/alibaba/block-traces).

## MSR Cambridge Traces
This is a block-level I/O trace collected in February 2007. It captures activity from 36 volumes (comprising 179 disks) across 13 enterprise servers in a production data center over the course of one week, starting at 5 PM GMT on February 22, 2007.

Each server was configured with a RAID-1 boot volume using two internal disks, and one or more RAID-5 data volumes backed by co-located, rack-mounted DAS. All servers ran Windows Server 2003 SP2, with data stored on NTFS volumes and accessed via protocols such as CIFS and HTTP. I/O requests were recorded using the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) tool. We note this dataset was collected to study power-saving strategies in enterprise storage systems.

Details of the trace can be found in [*Write Off-Loading: Practical Power Management for Enterprise Storage*](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/fast08/tech/full_papers/narayanan/narayanan.pdf).

### Trace format

- `Timestamp`: The time the I/O was issued, recorded in “Windows filetime” format.
- `Hostname`: The hostname of the server, which should match the hostname in the trace file name.
- `DiskNumber`: The logical disk number, which should match the disk number in the trace file name.
- `Type`: The type of I/O operation, either “Read” or “Write”.
- `Offset`: The starting offset of the I/O request in bytes from the beginning of the logical disk.
- `Size`: The transfer size of the I/O request in bytes.
- `ResponseTime`: The time taken by the I/O to complete, measured in Windows filetime units.
